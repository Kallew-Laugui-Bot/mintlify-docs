## Introduction

Hosting your website or API on GL Cloud is a breeze with the glcloud.app configuration file. This file allows you to customize and configure your application with essential parameters like the main file, memory allocation, version, display name, and more.

## Creating the glcloud.app configuration File
To get started, create your [glcloud.app](./how-to-create-your-glcloud-configuration-file) configuration file in the root directory of your project.

### Important website parameters
The **website port** needs to be **80**, if you are using a static website, you don't need to set the `START` parameter.

In glcloud.app configuration file:
- `SUBDOMAIN`: If you are hosting a website, set this parameter to your desired subdomain.
- `START`: A custom startup command (if needed).


<Note>Website url will be: `my-subdomain-parameter`.glweb.app</Note>
```systemd This example host a website without custom startup command
MAIN=index.html
MEMORY=512
VERSION=recommended
DISPLAY_NAME=My simple static website!
SUBDOMAIN=mysite-simple-website
```

```systemd This example use all parameters and custom startup command in a website
MAIN=index.js
MEMORY=512
VERSION=recommended
DISPLAY_NAME=My simple nextjs website!
SUBDOMAIN=mysite-nextjs-website
START=npm run build && npm run start
```

By following these steps, you'll have your website or API up and running smoothly on GL Cloud. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to our [support team](../company/support).
