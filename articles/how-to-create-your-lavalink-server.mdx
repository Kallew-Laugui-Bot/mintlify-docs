## Choosing the Version

Choose your desired version of `Lavalink` by clicking [here](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/releases/). We recommend selecting the latest version for the best experience.

## Creating the glcloud.app configuration File
To get started, create your [glcloud.app](./how-to-create-your-glcloud-configuration-file) configuration file in the root directory of your project.

## Creating the application.yml

Create a configuration file for your Lavalink server. You can access an example file [here](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/blob/master/LavalinkServer/application.yml.example).

<Warning>Set the `port` field in your `application.yml` file to: 80.</Warning>

## Enhancing Security

It is highly recommended to configure a secure password in the `password` field of your configuration file (application.yml). We recommend using a password with at least 32 characters.

<Note>It is important to remember that you must use port 443 (SSL) to connect to your lavalink.</Note>

## Uploading to GL Cloud

Create a compressed file (.zip) containing the Lavalink.jar and application.yml. Then, upload your configuration file to GL Cloud.

By following these steps, you'll have your Lavalink server up and running smoothly on GL Cloud. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to our [support team](../company/support).
