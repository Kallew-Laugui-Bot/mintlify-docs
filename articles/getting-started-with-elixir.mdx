## Introduction
This tutorial will have you deploying a Elixir app to GL Cloud in minutes.

The tutorial assumes that you have a [GL Cloud account](https://glcloud.app/login), and that you have [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) installed locally.

## Required Files
- Main file.
- mix.exs (dependency file).
- [glcloud.app](./how-to-create-your-glcloud-configuration-file) (file that contains the GL Cloud configuration).

## Preparing Files for Upload
Before hosting your project on GL Cloud, you must first have the files of your project properly configured, so that you can host it later.

Create your [glcloud.app](./how-to-create-your-glcloud-configuration-file) configuration file.

After the files of your project are ready just zip them in **.zip** format before uploading to GL Cloud.

# Uploading Files to GL Cloud

After preparing your project files, you can now upload them to GL Cloud and host your project.
Access the [GL Cloud Dashboard](https://glcloud.app/dashboard/upload) and upload your project files.
