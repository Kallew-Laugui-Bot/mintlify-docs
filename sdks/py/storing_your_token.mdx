title: "Storing Your API Key"
description: "In most CLI commands, it is necessary to provide your API key. This can be
done by passing the --token option, as shown in the example below:"
---

```bash
glcloud app-list --token <YOUR_API_TOKEN>
```

However, this is not the best way to store your API key. There is a
much better alternative.

## Environment Variables:

Alternatively, you can set your API key as an environment variable
named `glCLOUD-TOKEN`. The command will automatically read this variable
if the `--token` option is not used.

### Setting Your Environment Variable:

To set an environment variable named glCLOUD-TOKEN, use the
following command based on your operating system.

    <Tab title="Windows">
        ```bash
        setx glCLOUD-TOKEN "YOUR_API_TOKEN"
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Linux">
        ```bash
        export glCLOUD-TOKEN=YOUR_API_TOKEN
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>
