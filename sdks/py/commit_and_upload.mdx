[Application]: ../user_guide/client#application

You can make commits and uploads using Client or Application. You
just need a `glcloud.File` object and pass the path where your
zip file is.

## Making a commit

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Using Client">
    ````python
    import glcloud as gl

    client = gl.Client('API_KEY')

    async def example():
        file = gl.File('path/to/you/file.zip')
        await client.commit(file=file, app_id='application_id')
    ````
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Using Application">
    ````python
    import glcloud as gl

    client = gl.Client('API_KEY')

    async def example():
        app = await client.app(app_id='application_id')
        file = gl.File('path/to/you/file.zip')
        await app.commit(file=file)
    ````
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Using CLI">
    ````bash
    glcloud app <APP-ID> commit <FILE>
    ````
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Making a upload

To upload an application, you only use the [Client] and the CLI.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Using Client">
    ````python
    import glcloud as gl

    client = gl.Client(...)

    async def example():
        file = gl.File('path/to/you/file.zip')
        await client.upload_app(file=file)
    ````
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Using CLI">
    ````bash
    glcloud upload <ZIP>
    ````
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Remember that to upload an application you need a zip that contains (at least) the following files:**:

- Main file: responsible for starting your application
- Dependencies file: contains information about which dependencies are necessary
- Configuration file (glcloud.app): a configuration file specifying the
name,
description, main file name, version, etc. To learn more about the
configuration file, take a look at this [guide](https://docs.glcloud.app/articles/how-to-create-your-glcloud-configuration-file)

<Tip>
    For your convenience, a function has been added to create this configuration file:
    `glcloud.create_config_file`.
    
    You can also create the configuration file using the command line `glcloud create_config_file`.
