## Origin of the Logo

The logo of GL Cloud has been thoughtfully designed to reflect the values and objectives of our company. It consists of two gls positioned at a specific angle, resulting in an appearance that resembles a "Docker container."

### The Meaning Behind the Logo

1. **Two GLs**: The two gls in our logo represent the solid foundation on which we build our cloud infrastructure. Each gl symbolizes the robustness and reliability of our services.

2. **Docker Container**: The positioning of the gls was carefully chosen to evoke the image of a Docker container, which is a widely used technology in the world of cloud computing. This visually represents our flexible and adaptable approach to providing efficient and scalable solutions to our clients.

### The Flexible Infrastructure

Our company was born with the vision of creating a highly flexible cloud platform capable of meeting the ever-evolving needs of businesses of all sizes. The GL Cloud logo, with its angular gls, symbolizes this commitment to flexibility.

#### Key Features of Our Infrastructure:

1. **Elasticity**: Our infrastructure is designed to scale vertically and horizontally, allowing you to increase or decrease resources according to your business demands.

2. **Portability**: Just like Docker containers can run in different environments, our services can be easily migrated between public and private clouds, providing greater freedom of choice.

3. **Agility**: With container-based technology as the foundation, we can deploy solutions quickly, ensuring minimal downtime for deployments and updates.

4. **Scalability**: The two gls in our logo also represent the scalability of our services. With automated and optimized resources, we can handle intense and growing workloads.
