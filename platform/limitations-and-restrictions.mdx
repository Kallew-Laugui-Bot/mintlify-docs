## Minimum Resource Requirements

Every project hosted on the GL Cloud Platform has specific minimum resource requirements to ensure optimal performance:

- **Bots:** A minimum of 100MB of RAM is required for hosting.
- **Websites:** Websites need at least 512MB of RAM allocated to operate effectively.

Please note that while GL Cloud offers plans with up to 256GB of RAM, the maximum RAM allocation for any application is 32GB. If you require more than 32GB, please reach out to our support team for assistance.

## Storage Limitations

Storage limitations are crucial to ensure equitable resource distribution and to provide a high-quality experience for all users.

- **All projects:** Each project is allocated 20GB of virtual storage.
- **Free Plan:** Each project on the Free Plan is allocated 500MB/s (NVMe) of speed.
- **Paid Plan:** Each project on the Paid Plan is allocated 1.5GB/s (NVMe) of speed.

<Note>If you require speeds exceeding 1.5GB/s (NVMe), please don't hesitate to contact our support team for assistance.</Note>

## Network Limitations

Network limitations are essential to ensure fair resource distribution and a high-quality experience for all users. Here are the network limitations based on RAM allocation:

- **Less than 128MB RAM:** 25MB/s network speed.
- **Up to 256MB RAM:** 50MB/s network speed.
- **512MB RAM:** 100MB/s network speed.
- **1024MB RAM:** 150MB/s network speed.
- **2048MB RAM:** 200MB/s network speed.
- **4096MB RAM:** 250MB/s network speed.
- **8192MB RAM:** 300MB/s network speed.

For applications requiring network speeds exceeding 500MB/s, please contact our support team to discuss your specific needs.

GL Cloud is committed to providing a balance between resource availability and performance, ensuring a seamless experience for all users.

## Service Limits

### COMMERCIAL_USE

If an application on the free plan violates COMMERCIAL_USE, typically by engaging in commercial activities or misusing resources intended for non-commercial use, the application will be temporarily banned. During this temporary ban, the application itself cannot be started, restarted, or stopped. However, the user's account remains unaffected. This temporary ban acts as a corrective measure to enforce the terms of service and discourage resource misuse.
### ABUSE_STORAGE

In cases where an application is found to be in violation of ABUSE_STORAGE, involving excessive misuse or unauthorized utilization of storage resources, the application may face more severe consequences. As a measure to maintain resource integrity and fairness, the application may be subject to deletion. It is crucial to use storage resources responsibly and within the bounds of the terms and conditions.

GL Cloud is dedicated to providing a secure and balanced environment for all users while ensuring compliance with its policies.
