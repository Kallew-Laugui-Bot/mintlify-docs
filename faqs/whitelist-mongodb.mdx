When connecting your database to a app hosted on GL Cloud you may come across the possible error:
```
MongoNetworkError: connection 0 to shard-xxx-xxx.mongodb.net:27017 closed
```

You will receive this error message if you have not included the MongoDB Atlas addresses, the IP where your app is hosted, on the whitelist.

<Note>Due to how GL works in a way that has a dynamic IP, by an exclusive technology, it is impossible to provide you with an IP, since every restart in the application, you receive a unique IP.</Note>

So according to the [mongodb documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/security/ip-access-list/), you need to whitelist 0.0.0.0/0 IP address.
